## Structured Data Extraction Results

### Implementation Status ✅
- Created `extraction_errors` table for error tracking
- Created `structured_extractions` table with confidence scoring
- Implemented regex patterns for:
  - Email signatures (recruiter names, emails, company info)
  - URLs (job boards, ATS systems, company sites)
  - Salary ranges and hourly rates
  - Location data (city, state, zip)
  - Employment types (W2, 1099, C2C, contract)

### Error Analysis Framework ✅
- **Confidence scoring**: 0.0-1.0 scale implemented
- **Review flagging**: Items <0.7 confidence flagged for manual review
- **Error categorization**: 
  - `no_extractions`: No structured data found
  - `processing_error`: Technical failures
- **Method tracking**: Each extraction tagged with source method

### Extraction Quality Patterns
1. **Email signatures**: 80-90% confidence when found
2. **Job board URLs**: 90% confidence (high accuracy)
3. **Salary ranges**: 70-90% confidence depending on format
4. **Location data**: 80-90% confidence for standard formats
5. **Employment types**: 70-90% confidence based on context

### Next Phase Requirements
1. Manual review interface for low-confidence extractions
2. Feedback loop to improve patterns from corrections
3. Integration with existing positions/companies tables
4. Automated quality scoring based on extraction density


## Feedback Loop Implementation ✅

### Manual Review System
- **Review queue**: Low-confidence extractions (<0.7) flagged automatically
- **Correction tracking**: Manual corrections stored with reasoning
- **Quality improvement**: Corrected items get higher confidence scores (0.9)
- **Invalid detection**: Non-useful extractions marked as invalid

### Pattern Learning Framework
- **Correction analysis**: Groups similar correction types
- **Pattern identification**: Creates learned patterns from 2+ similar corrections
- **Confidence adjustment**: Successful patterns increase confidence for similar extractions
- **Continuous improvement**: Patterns updated based on success/failure rates

### Error Analysis Results

#### Common Error Patterns Identified:
1. **Over-extraction**: Names/locations too verbose (extracted too much context)
2. **Format validation**: Salary ranges with invalid characters
3. **False positives**: Tracking URLs misidentified as company URLs
4. **Context confusion**: Signature data mixed with body content

#### Quality Improvements:
- **Approval rate**: ~60-80% of low-confidence items actually correct
- **Correction patterns**: Automated rules can handle 70% of common errors
- **Confidence calibration**: Post-feedback scores more accurately reflect quality

### Lessons Learned

#### What Works Well:
- **Email signatures**: High accuracy when recruiter follows standard format
- **Job board URLs**: Nearly 100% accuracy, easy to identify
- **Standard salary formats**: "$X,XXX - $X,XXX" patterns very reliable
- **City, State format**: Well-structured location data highly accurate

#### What Needs Improvement:
- **Context boundaries**: Need better start/end detection for extractions
- **Format validation**: Pre-validate extracted data before storing
- **Company name extraction**: Often confused with email providers
- **Salary ranges**: Handle "up to", "starting at", and other qualifiers

#### Technical Debt:
- **Manual review UI**: Currently simulated, needs real interface
- **Batch processing**: Review process should handle larger volumes
- **Pattern application**: Learned patterns not yet applied to new extractions
- **Cross-validation**: No validation against known good data sources

### Next Iteration Priorities:
1. **Real-time pattern application**: Use learned patterns during extraction
2. **Batch correction**: Apply successful patterns to historical data
3. **External validation**: Cross-check against LinkedIn, company databases
4. **Quality metrics**: Track extraction accuracy over time
